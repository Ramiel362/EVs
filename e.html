            <h2>What is an Electric Vehicle (EV)?</h2>
            <p>Electric Vehicles (EVs) are vehicles that run on electricity instead of conventional fuel like petrol or diesel. EVs use electric motors and batteries, making them eco-friendly and more efficient than traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles. By relying on renewable electricity, EVs play a crucial role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and combating climate change.</p>
            <p>Most EVs use Lithium-Ion batteries, similar to the ones in smartphones, but on a much larger scale. These batteries can be recharged through home charging stations, public fast chargers, or specialised EV charging networks, making it easy to "refuel" an EV.</p>

              <h2>Why Electric Vehicles are Important</h2>
              <p>Electric Vehicles (EVs) are essential for building a sustainable future. They produce no tailpipe emissions, which significantly reduces air pollution in urban areas and helps address climate change by lowering greenhouse gases. EVs also decrease reliance on fossil fuels, making energy production and consumption cleaner and more efficient.</p>
              <p>Most EVs are cheaper to run over time due to lower fuel and maintenance costs.  As EV adoption grows, it supports job creation in green technology sectors, such as battery manufacturing, charging infrastructure, and renewable energy, further driving the transition to a sustainable economy and a sustainable environment.</p>
